# Registration Attachments - Prevent Re-Upload Fix

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Author:** Yousif  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 📋 Overview

Fixed the issue where images were being re-uploaded every time the user tried to submit the registration form. Now the system tracks which files have already been uploaded and skips them on subsequent submissions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Issue
When a user submitted the registration form multiple times (e.g., due to network error or validation failure on server), all images would be re-uploaded to the API, causing:
- Unnecessary bandwidth usage
- Slow submission times
- Duplicate files on the server
- Poor user experience

### Root Cause
The system had no way to track which files were already uploaded. Every submission would treat all files as new and upload them again.

---

## ✨ Solution

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Add Upload Tracking Flags**
   - Added `uploaded: boolean` flag to track upload status
   - Added `uploadedId: string` to store server-side image ID

2. **Skip Already Uploaded Files**
   - Filter out files with `uploaded === true` before upload loop
   - Collect already uploaded file metadata separately

3. **Mark Files After Upload**
   - Set `uploaded = true` after successful upload
   - Store `uploadedId` from API response
   - Store `path` from API response

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Show green "Uploaded ✓" badge for uploaded files
   - Add animated pulse indicator
   - Add tooltip warning when removing uploaded files

---

## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. Updated UploadedFile Interface

**File:** `src/validations/attachments.validation.ts`

```typescript
export interface UploadedFile {
    id: string;              // Client-side unique ID
    file: File;              // The actual file object
    preview?: string;        // Object URL for image preview
    type: string;            // Field name (e.g., "studentPhotos")
    path?: string;           // Server URL after upload
    uploaded?: boolean;      // NEW: Track if already uploaded
    uploadedId?: string;     // NEW: Server-side image ID
}
```

**Zod Schema Update:**
```typescript
const createFileField = (message: string) =>
    z.array(
        z.object({
            id: z.string(),
            file: z.instanceof(File),
            preview: z.string().optional(),
            type: z.string(),
            path: z.string().optional(),
            uploaded: z.boolean().optional(),    // NEW
            uploadedId: z.string().optional(),   // NEW
        })
    )
    .min(1, message);
```

### 2. Updated Upload Logic

**File:** `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/registration/form/attachments/page.tsx`

#### A. Filter Out Already Uploaded Files

```typescript
// Collect only NEW files that need uploading
const allFiles: Array<{ file: File; type: string; fieldName: string; uploadedFile: UploadedFile }> = [];

Object.entries(values).forEach(([fieldName, uploadedFiles]) => {
    const imageType = IMAGE_TYPE_MAP[fieldName] || "0";
    uploadedFiles.forEach((uploaded) => {
        // ✅ Only include files that haven't been uploaded yet
        if (!uploaded.uploaded) {
            allFiles.push({
                file: uploaded.file,
                type: imageType,
                fieldName,
                uploadedFile: uploaded,
            });
        }
    });
});
```

#### B. Collect Already Uploaded Images

```typescript
// Collect already uploaded images to include in final payload
const alreadyUploadedImages: Array<{ ids: string; path: string; type: string }> = [];

Object.entries(values).forEach(([fieldName, uploadedFiles]) => {
    const imageType = IMAGE_TYPE_MAP[fieldName] || "0";
    uploadedFiles.forEach((uploaded) => {
        if (uploaded.uploaded && uploaded.uploadedId && uploaded.path) {
            alreadyUploadedImages.push({
                ids: uploaded.uploadedId,
                path: uploaded.path,
                type: imageType,
            });
        }
    });
});
```

#### C. Skip Upload Step If All Files Uploaded

```typescript
// If all files are already uploaded, skip upload step
if (allFiles.length === 0) {
    toast.success(tToast("all_images_uploaded") || "All images already uploaded!");

    // Submit registration with existing images
    const payload = {
        ...transformToApiPayload(studentInfo, familyInfo, educationHealth),
        images: alreadyUploadedImages,
    };

    mutation.mutate(payload);
    return;
}
```

#### D. Mark Files as Uploaded After Upload

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < allFiles.length; i++) {
    const { file, type, fieldName, uploadedFile } = allFiles[i];

    try {
        const uploadResponse = await uploadRegistrationImage(file, type);
        
        uploadedImages.push({
            ids: uploadResponse.id,
            path: uploadResponse.path,
            type: uploadResponse.type,
        });
        
        uploadedIds.push(uploadResponse.id);

        // ✅ Update the form field to mark as uploaded
        const currentFieldValue = form.getValues(fieldName as keyof AttachmentsFormValues);
        const updatedFiles = (currentFieldValue as UploadedFile[]).map((uf) =>
            uf.id === uploadedFile.id
                ? {
                      ...uf,
                      path: uploadResponse.path,
                      uploaded: true,              // Mark as uploaded
                      uploadedId: uploadResponse.id, // Store server ID
                  }
                : uf
        );
        form.setValue(fieldName as keyof AttachmentsFormValues, updatedFiles as any);
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
}
```

#### E. Combine All Images in Final Payload

```typescript
// Combine newly uploaded images with already uploaded ones
const allUploadedImages = [...alreadyUploadedImages, ...uploadedImages];

// Transform to API payload with all image paths
const payload = {
    ...transformToApiPayload(studentInfo, familyInfo, educationHealth),
    images: allUploadedImages,
};

mutation.mutate(payload);
```

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### A. Form File Component

**File:** `src/components/ui/form-file.tsx`

Updated the interface to include new fields:

```typescript
interface UploadedFile {
    id: string;
    file: File;
    preview?: string;
    type: string;
    path?: string;
    uploaded?: boolean;      // NEW
    uploadedId?: string;     // NEW
}
```

#### B. Image Preview List Component

**File:** `src/components/ui/image-preview-list.tsx`

**Updated Interface:**
```typescript
interface UploadedFile {
    id: string;
    file: File;
    preview?: string;
    type: string;
    path?: string;
    uploaded?: boolean;      // NEW
    uploadedId?: string;     // NEW
}
```

**Added Upload Indicator:**
```tsx
{uploadedFile.uploaded && uploadedFile.path && (
    <p className="text-xs text-green-600 mt-0.5 flex items-center gap-1 font-medium">
        <span className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-500 rounded-full animate-pulse"></span>
        Uploaded ✓
    </p>
)}
```

**Enhanced Remove Button:**
```tsx
<button
    type="button"
    onClick={() => onRemove(uploadedFile.id)}
    className="..."
    aria-label="Remove file"
    title={uploadedFile.uploaded ? "Remove (will need to re-upload on next submit)" : "Remove file"}
>
    <X className="h-4 w-4" />
</button>
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Indicators

1. **Uploaded Badge**
   - Green text with checkmark: "Uploaded ✓"
   - Animated green pulse dot
   - Font weight: medium (more prominent)

2. **Remove Button Tooltip**
   - Uploaded files: "Remove (will need to re-upload on next submit)"
   - New files: "Remove file"
   - Warns user about consequences

3. **Toast Notifications**
   - "All images already uploaded!" when skipping upload
   - "Uploading images (X files)..." with file count
   - "Images uploaded successfully!" after new uploads

---

## 🔄 Upload Flow

### First Submission Attempt

```
User selects files
    ↓
Files added to form with uploaded = false
    ↓
User clicks submit
    ↓
System uploads all files to /studentImage
    ↓
Files marked with uploaded = true, uploadedId, path
    ↓
Registration submitted to /students
    ↓
If success: clear form and redirect
If error: files stay marked as uploaded
```

### Second Submission Attempt (After Error)

```
User clicks submit again
    ↓
System filters: 
  - alreadyUploadedImages (uploaded = true)
  - allFiles (uploaded = false)
    ↓
If allFiles.length === 0:
  → Skip upload, use alreadyUploadedImages only
    ↓
If allFiles.length > 0:
  → Upload only new files
  → Combine with alreadyUploadedImages
    ↓
Registration submitted with combined images array
```
