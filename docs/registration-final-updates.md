---

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ All validation schemas match API structure
- ✅ All form components have correct field names
- ✅ All three locales have complete translations
- ✅ Mapper handles all type transformations
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in project
- ✅ No JSON syntax errors in locales
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

---

## Next Steps

### Testing Phase
1. **Unit Tests:** Test validation schemas with valid/invalid data
2. **Integration Tests:** Test complete form submission flow
3. **i18n Tests:** Verify all labels appear in all languages
4. **Type Tests:** Ensure mapper transformations work correctly

### Future Enhancements
1. Add phone number format validation
2. Add age auto-calculation from birthday
3. Add cross-field validation (graduation > enrollment year)
4. Add address autocomplete
5. Implement progressive form saving
6. Add file upload for documents

---

## Support Notes

### Common Troubleshooting
- **TypeScript errors:** Verify schema validation uses strings, mapper does number conversion
- **Optional fields:** Use `|| ""` or `|| 0` for fallback values
- **Nested fields:** Ensure dot notation in field names (e.g., `mother.full_name`)
- **Locale issues:** Check JSON structure is valid, no duplicate keys

### Key Design Decisions
1. **String validation:** Prevents Zod type inference issues with z.coerce
2. **Separate transformation:** Keeps validation logic separate from type conversion
3. **Factory pattern:** `parentSchema()` ensures consistency between mother/father
4. **Nested structure:** Matches API requirements directly

---

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**No Errors:** TypeScript compilation clean  
**No Warnings:** JSON syntax valid  
**Ready For:** Testing and deployment

## 1. Toast Localization

Added localized toast messages for all three languages (en, ar, id) to provide proper user feedback during registration submission.

### Toast Keys Added

**Path:** `locales/{en,ar,id}.json`

```json
"toast": {
    "registration_success": "...",
    "registration_error": "...",
    "complete_steps": "...",
    "submitting": "..."
}
```

**Usage:**
- `registration_success` - Shown when registration is submitted successfully
- `registration_error` - Shown when registration submission fails
- `complete_steps` - Shown when user tries to submit without completing previous steps
- `submitting` - Shown during the submission process

---

## 2. Submit Button with Loading State

Updated the submit button in the attachments page to show a loading indicator during submission.

**Changes:**
- Added `Loader2` icon from `lucide-react`
- Button displays spinner and "Submitting..." text when `mutation.isPending || isUploading`
- Button is disabled during upload and submission to prevent duplicate submissions

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<Button disabled={mutation.isPending || isUploading}>
    {mutation.isPending || isUploading ? (
        <>
            <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
            {tToast("submitting")}
        </>
    ) : (
        tCommon("continue")
    )}
</Button>
```

---

## 3. Multi-Image Upload Support

Enhanced `FormFile` component to support multiple file uploads with image previews.

### Component Updates

**Path:** `src/components/ui/form-file.tsx`

**New Features:**
- `multiple` prop to enable multi-file selection
- Image preview grid for selected files
- Remove button (X icon) on hover to delete individual images
- Automatic FileList to File[] conversion
- Preview URL cleanup on file removal

**Props:**
```tsx
interface FormInputProps {
    multiple?: boolean; // New prop
    // ... other existing props
}
```

**Preview Grid:**
- 2-column grid layout
- Thumbnail images (h-24, object-cover, rounded-lg)
- Hover overlay with delete button
- Automatic URL revocation on removal

---

## 4. Image Upload API Integration

Implemented image upload functionality that uploads files one by one and stores returned paths.

### Service Layer

**Path:** `src/services/registration.service.ts`

**New Functions:**

```typescript
// Upload single image, returns path string
export async function uploadRegistrationImage(file: File): Promise<string>

// Upload multiple images sequentially
export async function uploadRegistrationImages(files: File[]): Promise<string[]>
```

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /students/images`
- Sends `FormData` with `image` field
- Returns `{ path: string }`

### Submission Flow

**Path:** `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/registration/form/attachments/page.tsx`

**Process:**
1. User selects files (single or multiple)
2. On submit, all files are uploaded sequentially
3. API returns path for each uploaded file
4. Paths are stored in localStorage under `attachments` key
5. Paths are included in final registration payload
6. Registration is submitted with all data + attachment paths
7. localStorage is cleared on success

**State Management:**
- `isUploading` state tracks upload progress
- Button disabled during upload and submission
- Error handling with localized error messages

---

## 5. localStorage Integration for Attachments

File paths returned from the image API are stored in localStorage before final submission.

**Key:** `ags_attachments`

**Structure:**
```typescript
{
    imagePaths: string[] // Array of paths returned from API
}
```

**Usage:**
- Paths are stored after all images are uploaded successfully
- Paths are included in the final registration payload
- All registration data (including attachments) is cleared on successful submission

---
